I am a PhD student at UC San Diego advised by
[Pat Pannuto](https://patpannuto.com). My
research involves building systems that are,
by-default, secure and robust.

I love working on low-level systems, and my
research centers around operating systems. More
specifically, I am interested in how programming
language and verification methods can be pragmatically
applied to real systems, to solve real problems.

Beyond my research, I am an active contributor
to [TockOS](https://tockos.org)---an embedded OS
designed to securely run multiple applications
on resource constrained microcontrollers. I maintain
the IEEE 802.15.4 and OpenThread network stack in Tock.
